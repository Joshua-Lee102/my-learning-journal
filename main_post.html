              I've made the big jump over to the Bootcamp to get expert code reviews of

      <h3 class = "post-subheading">How I stay committed to learning</h3>
      <p class = "post-subtext">I like to think of myself as a lifelong learner. I used to spend hours and hours learning, 
        then try to create simple projects using what I learned or work new techniques into existing projects.</p>
      <p class = "post-subtext">While that was fun, I felt like it would be helpful to share what I was learning and most things about 
        my journey with the world.</p>
      <h3 class = "post-subheading">How I got started</h3>
      <p class = "post-subtext">I started simple and gradually grew my learning journal site. I would take notes about what I was 
        learning. After each learning session, I'd use my notes to not only reflect on what I learned but also 
        write short summaries of what I learned using my own words.</p>
      <p class = "post-subtext">That helped me grow what I was learning, and I realized that posting my learning summaries was also 
        helping others learn and stay motivated.</p>
